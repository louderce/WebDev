			<h2>Here are a few great links to other blogs containing great recipies and other resources!</h2>
			<p> This site is still brand new and a work in-progress. I wanted to share
        some of my favorite tried-and-true resources with you. The links below are
        reources that I myself have used in the past, or currently use.

						<h3><a href="https://ohsheglows.com/recipe-categories/">Oh She Glows</a> - Vegan food blog</h3>
						<div id="ohsheglows">
						</div>
          <p>Fun fact: I was vegan for two years for health reasons. I learned SO
            much from this blog; many of the recipes I still use today. I love that
            this blog focuses on hearty, veggie-forward meals that fill you up and give you
            plenty energy! No imitation meat substitute here, just great tasting,
            satisfying food so good, you won't miss the meat, I promise!

          <h3>Shameless Plug! My personal food blog - <a href="https://thissavorylife.com/">This Savory Life</a></h3>
					<div id="savory">
					</div>
          <p>This is a food blog that I started a few years ago at the request of
            my friends and family. It is built with wordpress and does <i>not</i>
            meet the requirements for this assignment, but it cotains some of my
            favorite creations. I really should get around to adding more content!
          </p>


          <h3>Fantastic recipe for curried lentel soup - <a href="https://www.thecuriouschickpea.com/masoor-dal-tadka/">Masoor Dal Tadka</a></h3>
					<div id="tadka">
					</div>
          <p>One of my best friends referred this recipe to me, and its one of my favorie
            go-tos. Make sure to read the introduction to the recipe; there is really
            great information on how to get the best flavor outcome, including methods
            and explainations!
          </p>
