		<h2>Want to learn more?</h2>
		<p>Have you found a passion in cooking? Or is learning to cook part of a larger lifestyle change?
			Maybe you want to impress friends and family with some new skils. Maybe you want to focus more
			on a specific style or dish. What ever your reason, if you're ready to take your cooking to the
			next level there is a class for you!
		</p>

		<h3>Here is a breakdown of my current class offerings</h3>
		<p> Classes are taught live. Each week includes downloadable recipies, shopping list, and any
			relavent video tutorials to keep for reference. Weeknight classes are 45 minutes long
			and feature meals that can be made in 30 min or less including prep time. The 45 minutes
			allows for the explaination of the recipe as well as any questions from you. There will
			be a brief summary of the class including any final follow-up questions. Weekender
			classes will feature slightly more upscale cuisine, still taught at a beginner level. These
			classes range from 60 to 70 minutes including explaination of recipe, questions, and follow up.
			Weekender classes feature meals that by nature take slightly longer to prepare.
