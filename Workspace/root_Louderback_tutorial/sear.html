			<h2>Let's learn how to how to get that perfect sear!</h2>
			<p> To sear means to cook on a hot pan at medium-high or high heat so as to brown or slightly
				char a food. This is most commonly done with meat such as beef, pork or fish.
				You may also sear hardy fish such as swardfish or tuna. When searing, it
				is important to use a cooking oil with a higher smoke point, avoid butter and
				some extra virgin olive oils. Typically, seasoning is added to the food before it is put into the pan.
				Save any herbs for the very end of cooking, or opt to mix herbs with butter ahead of time to add to food
				once it is finished in the pan. The key to a great sear is to get the pan nice and hot before you add your food.
				It is ideal to use a thicker pan allowing for best heat retention,
				but realistically, just use what you have. If using cast-iron, it is best not to use more than medium heat.
				The cast ironwill get plenty hot and give you a perfect sear if your patient. <br><br> Tip:
					you can check to see if your pan is hot enough by holding you hand over it for a few seconds,
					or alternitavely, dropping a drop or two of water on your pan. If the water "dances" across the pan, its ready.
					<b>be careful not to accidentally touch the pan. Also, water can spatter when added to
					 hot oil, so be careful to only ad a drop or two.</b> Also getting the pan too hot may
						result in oil spattering when you add your food. Just be mindful of your pan,
						and dont walk away from it while it's coming to heat.
