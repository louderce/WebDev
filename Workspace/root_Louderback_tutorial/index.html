		<h2>Welcome to Scratch Tutorials</h2>
		<p>I was inspired to create this website by friends and fmaily who were learing to cook.
			Some of us cook becasue we are passionate about delicious food, and want to learn all the best techniques
			and folow exciting, complex recipies. Others, well, not so much. Some of us cook becasue we have to, and
			that's okay. Whether you are wanting to pick up a new hobby, or running out of cash for takeout, I'm here
			to help; judgement free! <br><br> This website is designed to be entry level -for complete beginners.
			Some of us grew up in households with people who cooked frequently and the vocabulary comes more naturally.
			Others may have grown up with frozen lasagna and dinner on-the-go. And for some, neither of those are the case.
			Whatever your background, I hope you find my website easy to use, and the tutorials easy to understand.
		</p>
		<p>I would love to hear from you! Would you like clarification regarding one of the tutorials featured on this site?
			If there are any other methods you would like me to do a tutorial for, please let me know!<br>
