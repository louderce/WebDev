			<h2>Let's learn how to poach and egg!</h2>
			<p> Poach is a fancy way of saying to boily gently in water. Eggs aren't
				the only food that can be poached, you may also encounter poached fish or
				chicken in recipies from time to time. Because eggs are the most common,
				I chose to focus on those. The key to a successful poached egg is to boil
				it <i>gently</i>, if the water is boiling too rapidly, you risk breaking the
				delecate yolk. Also, you only need enough water to cover the egg. There is no
				benifit to cracking an egg into a full pot of water; its simply not necessary
				and may just making things more diffucult than they need to be <br><br> All you
				need is a pot of hot water brought to a gentile boil -just a bove a simmer, and
				an egg. Some people like to add a tablespoon or two of vinegar to the water help
				keep the egg together, but honestly I've never had that issue. Note, cracking a
				cold egg into a pot of water will bring the temperature of the water down momentarily.
				It is not recommended to poach more than 4 eggs at a time for beginners.
			<h4>Let's grab some supplies:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Pot of water</li>
				<li>an egg</li>
				<li>A larger spoon to remove the egg from the water</li>
