			<h2>Let's learn what it means to sautee!</h2>
			<p> When we sautee something, we're really just  cookng food by moving it around on a hot pan in a
				little bit of oil. Most sauteeing is done over medium heat, and can be a relatively short or longer
				process depending upon what is in the pan. Aromatics such as onion, and hearty root vegitables will take
				longer to cook, while more delecate foods like zucchini or shrimp will cook much faster. <br><br> When it comes to seasoning,
				salt and spices such as black pepper should be added right after adding your food to the heated pan to
				allow for optimum flavor development. It is typically best to add herbs tword the middle or end of the
				sauteeing process to keep them from becoming overcooked or scortched as they may become bitter or overpower
				the natural flavors of the food. Garlic should be added last to allow for the best flavor and aromatics.
				Cook for only a minute or two for optimal results. like herbs, when overcooked it can become bitter tasting.<br><br>
				The amount of oil used depends on the type of pan you are cooking in. If using non-stick cookware, you can get away
				with using less oil. If you are using stainless cookware, you will need to make sure use sufficient oil to keep
				the food from sticking. If you use stainless cookware and notice food keeps sticking to the bottom of the pan,
				the pan is either too hot, or you aren't using enough oil. Because you need more oil when using stainless steel,
				 I typically try to use heart-healthy olive oil. Because we usually sautee at medium temperature, the lower
				 <b>smoke-point</b> of extra-virgin olive oil doesn't present a problem. Whenever possible, I try to avoid
				 cooknig with butter. Yes, butter can really enhance the flavor of food, but it browns SO quickly! Butter
				 is liable to burn before the rest of the food is cooked, and will easily cause the food to stick and/or
				 the pan to smoke. If you want the delicious aromatics of butter, add it in very last as you would garlic.

				<b>Smoke-point</b>- The temperature or heat level at which a cooking oil begins to smoke. This typically
				appears light in color, similar in appearence to water vapor.
